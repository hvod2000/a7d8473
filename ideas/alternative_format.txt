dir/	- directory
txt	- simple file
/exe	- executable
ln/t	- soft link
$	- end of file content
	- end of directory list

Ok, the above requires encoding of filenames. I don't like it.
However we still can use "$ \n" as the end of file content.
Also we can store link content as file content for consistency.
